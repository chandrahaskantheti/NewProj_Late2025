# This projects folder will contain a series of projects pertaining to Python

This folder will contain projects for different levels and concepts that I devote towards my self learning and understanding and for cyber security, ML, and high performance computing. 

One might say a last attempt at the Software Engineering world and SDE/SWE world.

For me, this repo is my proof that I can code, debug, script, and prove that I don't lack coding skills, mastery and adaptability of new concepts,
and am willing to turn a new leaf in my career.
